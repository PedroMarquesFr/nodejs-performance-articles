## Introduction

Node.js is a powerful and popular JavaScript runtime that enables developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. However, to achieve optimal performance, it's essential to understand common performance issues and apply appropriate optimization techniques. This repository aims to provide clear and practical examples to address those challenges.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/), some examples will also require docker and mongodb knowledge.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-performance-examples.git
```

3. Change into the repository directory:

```bash
cd nodejs-performance-examples
```

4. Explore the various examples in the `examples/` directory. Each example is organized into its own folder and comes with a detailed README that explains the problem, the performance improvements applied, and how to run the optimized version.

## Examples

The repository contains a diverse set of performance examples covering different aspects of Node.js applications. Here are some of the examples you will find:

1. **Memory Optimization**: Learn how to identify and reduce memory leaks and unnecessary memory usage in your Node.js applications.

2. **Event Loop Performance**: Understand how the event loop works and how to optimize it to handle a high number of concurrent connections efficiently.

3. **File System Operations**: Optimize file system read and write operations to minimize I/O bottlenecks.

4. **Caching Strategies**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the response time of frequently accessed data.

5. **Database Performance**: Optimize database queries and connection handling to improve overall application performance.

6. **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Learn how to leverage Worker Threads and Clustering to perform tasks concurrently and in parallel.

... and more!
